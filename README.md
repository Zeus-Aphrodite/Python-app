# 15 Minute Apps

A collection of 15 small — *minute* — desktop applications written in Python
using the PyQt framework. These apps are intended as examples from
which you can poke, hack and prod your way to writing your own tools.

## Want to build your own apps?

> If you think these apps are neat and want to learn more about
PyQt in general, [take a look at my ebook & online course
"Create Simple GUI Applications"](https://martinfitzpatrick.name/create-simple-gui-applications)
which covers everything you need to know to start building your own applications with PyQt.

You can also find more PyQt articles, tutorials and projects 
[on my website](http://martinfitzpatrick.name/tag/pyqt).
