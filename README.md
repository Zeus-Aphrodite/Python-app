# Minute Apps

A collection of minute (small) desktop applications written in Python
using the PyQt framework. These apps are intended as examples from
which you can poke, hack and prod your way to writing your own tools.

If you find these apps interesting, or want to learn more about
PyQt in general, [take a look at my ebook & online course
"Create Simple GUI Applications"](https://martinfitzpatrick.name/create-simple-gui-applications)
which covers everything you need to know to get you programming with PyQt.

Write-ups of these apps, including design explanations and walkthroughs, can be found [on my site]().

All code is **licensed under an MIT license**. This allows you to re-use the code freely,
remixed in both commercial and non-commercial projects. The only requirement is that you must
include the MIT license file when distributing.
